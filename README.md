Anaconda docker image

There were some periodic problems with official (continuuumIO) docker images, that is why current repository was created.

Docker file provides 
1. ubuntu 18.04
2. [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) (check docker [file](https://github.com/yantonov/anaconda-docker/blob/master/python3/Dockerfile) to get anaconda version)
